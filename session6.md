## Chain of events

### Valechia

We arrive in town and decide that it would be best to look for an inn first. We find one named "The Blue Water Inn". The raven, which was still following us, settled down on a tree next to the inn. We decided to stay the night here, and after a good lunch we all went to sleep.

As everyone went to bed, our Kenku was lead outside by the innkeeper. He took our kenku to the kitchen and introduced his family. They were all part of a group called the "Keepers of the Feather", which opposed Strahd and wanted to offer our party their help. They gave us more information abour Strahd, and asked us to run a little errand for them. The inns wine suppy has been dwindling lately, and our job is to visit the "Wizards Of Wines" Winery, to see what has happened.

The next morning, after a healthy breakfast, we went to explore the town a little. As we headed toward the town square, we began noticing that a festival was soon to start. All around town we saw proclamations:

    Come one, come all,
    to the greatest celebration of the year:
    THE WOLF'S HEAD JAMBOREE!
    Attendance and children required.
    Pikes will be provided.
    ALL WILL BE WELL!
    -The Baron-

We soon also passed some cages, filled with townsfolks, both adults and children, wearing donkey heads. When asking a guard, we were informed the caged people were arrested for "malicious unhappiness" (spreading negative opinions about the upcoming festival). All of them looked wery famished.

When the main event of the festival kicked off, people were invited to grab a pike. As soon as they did, they started beating the caged ones with their pikes. This continued until the caged folks were bloodied and barely concious.

While tempted, we decided not to intervene as to not make the town villify us immediately.

Once the main event was over, the people in the cages were medically tended to, and new posters were put up all over town for a different festival in town that was going to happen in three days.
