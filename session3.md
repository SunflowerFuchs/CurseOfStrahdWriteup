## Chain of events

### Barovia 

#### House

##### Basement

We had decided to go back into the basement to meet up with the rest of the squad who should be awake by now. We all team up again, and continue exploring the basement.

We split up, so Lilly and Rivet went back to the coffins, while the rest of us continued past the spike pit. 

The coffin squad decided to open the coffins and check out what's inside them, while the pit squad met some unpleasant guests in the form of three ghouls.

While the pit squad got ready to fight the ghouls, the coffin squad found a bunch of bugs. Way, way too agressive bugs, with way too many legs.
The bugs were quickly dealt with, and afterwards they joined back up to the other squad.
With all of them back together, the ghouls were quick to be dealt with.

They decided this floor was done for now, and they continued down to the lower basement.

##### Basement, Level 2

In the lower floor there wasn't much. There was a big empty room through which we entered, an empty hallway made to chain people up, and a big iron gate. The iron gate moved without much effort, and lead us to a big room filled with water, with a big stone platform in the middle.

When Lilly and Roux stepped on the platform, they began seeing some shadowy, human-like hooded figures around the room, repeatedly saying "One must die".

Meanwhile, the others went to inspect the mound of moss and plants on the other side of the room, when the mound suddenly started moving.
Turns out, mounds don't like being woken up.

The fight started out good, with everyone giving their best, until Roux grabbed their unholy book and cast a very painful spell, both for them and the mound. Shortly after, the mound got a hold of Duncan and managed to keep him from escaping, knocking him out shortly after. 
The team quickly destroyed the mound afterwards, and after Duncan was healed and gave a stern speech to the parents ghosts, everyone decided it was best to return to an inn for the night.

Outside, they saw the dog again, and after everyone agressively fought with each other to pet it, Rivet decided to make it his new mount.
