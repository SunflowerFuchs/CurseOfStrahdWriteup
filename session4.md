# Writeup from Session 4

## Chain of events

### Barovia 

#### Inn

After we all woke up, we grabbed a bite to eat for breakfast. We got some infos about Strahd from the barkeep, and met someone who told us who this dog belongs to.

After he told us about the dog, he told us about his sister, Irene, who was under constant threat of Lord Strahd. We agreed to try and help her.

We decide to first head out to return the dog to its owner, a young girl living nearby.

#### At the house of the dogs owner

When we arrived at her house, all the openings were barricaded.
We managed to break the barricades on one of the doors. Once inside, we met an old lady with a doll. She told us that the girl we're looking for is her daughter, and she's gone missing. We agreed to try and help her too, but for now, we just left the dog, barricaded the door again, and left.

We were then approached by a lady selling pies. Many of us were extremely suspicious of this lovely old lady. We recieved some pies, and after we managed to upset the lady, she left.

We decided to continue on to Irenes house now.

#### At Irenes house

After arriving and getting to know each other, Irene told us about her problem with Strahd. He seems to believe she's the reincarnation of his former love. He's been relentlessly trying to turn her, and maker her his.
She also explained that the safest thing for her to do right now is to travel to Valechia.

Traveling to Valechia was going to take more than a day, so we decided to leave as soon as we can.

### Path to Valechia

As soon as it went dark, we heard a growling coming out of the bushes. We were surrounded by a pack of wolves, and they quickly closed in.
It was a fight not without its damages, but we managed to fend them off.
